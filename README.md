## Description
üîç Bird Brains is an application for disrupting the bird watching industry. This application allows users to log bird sightings, receive a score based on their sighting, view other sightings, view high scores, and more!  This is a full-stack node express application with server-side rendering generated via handlebars.  Our application follows the model-view-controller design pattern.
